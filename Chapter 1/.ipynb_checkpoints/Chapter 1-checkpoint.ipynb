    "Have you ever wondered what the purpose of life is? Not for humans specifically but for all lifeforms on earth? The answer is relatively straightforward. It is to procreate, making offspring is the name of the game. Ensuring that your genes get transferred beyond your own lifespan. Just look at bacteria, it is all about growing and creating offspring. We'll employ this principle in detail when we start to model our [anaerobic digesters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_digestion). \n",

    "In order to procreate an organism requires energy, in fact in the bacterial kingdom about 99% of energy is spent on procreation (or growth). Live can be interpreted as a scramble for energy, without it life is not possible. Food contains the energy that organisms require to grow. In this chapter we'll be looking at how humans obtain and use energy. Before we can start with calculations we need a throrough background on the process of obtaining energy from food. Below you will find a consise introduction with numerous references. If you feel that you are thrown into the deep side, it is a good thing, at least the confused mind is aware of the fact that a picture has not formed yet.

    "\n",
    "It was about 2 billion years ago when the [development of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) made a major breakthrough in obtaining energy in an oxygen-rich environment. During this event an [archaea cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea) consumed a [bacterial cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria). The consumed bacterial cell did not get digested but managed to survive within the archaea cell. The bacterial cell formed a beneficial [symbiotic relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis) with the archea cell, by exchanging [ATP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate) for nutritional molecules. This beneficial relationship resulted in the formation of all [multicellular life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote). Over time the bacterial cell altered itself to become the [mitochondrion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion). Today there are about 300 000 mitochondria (bacterial remnant) in each human cell that facilitate the process of [aerobic respiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration). The mitochondrion has its own unique [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) when compared to the DNA in the [nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus) of each human cell, thus providing evidence of its single cell origin. \n",

    "Pyruvate or [pyruvic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyruvic_acid) is a very important molecule to consider when trying to understand how energy (ATP) is derived from food. You are probably familiar with the fact that all your energy is derived from either [carbohydrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate), [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein) and [fats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat). Pyruvic acid can be seen as the metabolic intermediate obtained from the breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins and fat. It is also the feed molecule to the mitochondria. The resulting products from this reaction is COâ‚‚, water and ATP. In our analysis we will be using the carbohydrate [glucose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose) as the standard starting molecule for generating energy (ATP) since glucose is the most common energy containing substance in human blood. It is important to understand that fatty acids from fats and amino acids from proteins can also be used as energy supply. Similar to glucose these molecules will break down to pyruvic acid before entering the mitochondria.  \n",

    "It is useful to think of the combustion of coal when thinking about generating energy in your own body. The energy generation process is all about burning molecules with carbon backbones in an oxygen rich environment to form water and COâ‚‚. When coal is burned there is a fire and things get very hot, but when food is burned we need to perform the operation at 37C and accordingly we need some fancy catalysts called enzymes to facilitate the process. Over 4.5 years of evolution nature has developed the most beautiful set of chemistry to release energy from molecules like carbohydraytes, proteins and fats. It is amazing to realise that the amoba in the pond below Engineering 1 building uses the exact same set of chemistry steps to generate energy as we humans do. \n"

This figure assumes that only daily task are performed, since additional exercise will increase the number. Let's assume for now that the man, let's call him Ben, only consumes Coke for his diet. This is off course not a very healthy diet but it will at least simplify the calculations. The first question to answer is how many Coke cans (330mL) will Ben require in a day to sustain himself?

    "Let's now try and calculate the amount of ATP molecules that get's generated per second in Ben's body. In order to do this we must look at glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Note that the six carbon molecule of glucose splits into two 3 carbon molecules and that each of these go onto the TCA cycle. Also note that GTP is the same as ATP. You will also have to count the amount of NADH that forms, since NADH is used in oxidative phosphorilation to generate ATP. Note that $QH_2$ in the graph above is the same as FADH. FADH is an electron carrier similar to NADH, only difference is that the electrons in FADH contains slightly less energy.
