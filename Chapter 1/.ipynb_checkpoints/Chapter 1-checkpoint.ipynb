    "In Chemical Reaction Engineering we have need to keep track of certain species as they relate to certain reaction within the reaction system. This requires what is termed the \"General Mole Balance\" and is a variation on the well known \"Mass Balance\" but in this case tracks the production/consumption of specific components within the reaction system. For this an understanding of the system boundaries are required - is the system open or closed? \n",

    "\n",
    "In order to determine the reaction rate used in the mole balance, a reaction rate term is required to track the production/consumption of species in the reactor. This was done previously in CTD 223 when you needed to calculate the heats of reaction generated by certain species in different reactions. This was defined using the concept of \"Extent of reaction\" which was described by the following equation for the reaction $aA + bB \\to cC$:\n",
