    "### Batch reactor\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch reactors are a type of chemical reactor used in the industry for carrying out chemical reactions in discrete batches, as opposed to continuous operation. In a batch reactor, all the reactants are added at the beginning of the process, and the reaction progresses over time until the desired product is formed. These reactors offer several advantages, such as ease of operation, flexibility in managing different reaction conditions, and the ability to handle various chemical processes efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "General Applications of Batch Reactors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pharmaceutical Industry: Batch reactors are extensively used in pharmaceutical manufacturing to synthesize a wide range of drugs, intermediates, and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The batch process allows precise control over reaction parameters and facilitates the production of small batches for research and development purposes or larger batches for commercial production.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Specialty Chemicals: The production of specialty chemicals often involves complex multi-step reactions. Batch reactors are ideal for these applications because they enable precise control of each step and facilitate the addition of reactants, catalysts, or other compounds at specific times to optimize the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Food and Beverage Industry: Batch reactors find use in the food and beverage sector for the production of various products such as sauces, condiments, and beverages. They allow for controlled mixing, heating, and cooling, ensuring consistent quality and flavors in each batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Petrochemicals: Batch reactors play a role in the petrochemical industry for refining crude oil into valuable products like gasoline, diesel, and various petrochemical derivatives. Batch processes are often used for specific refining steps that require careful control.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Polymerization: Polymer production involves chemical reactions to create long chains of repeating molecules. Batch reactors are commonly used in the polymerization process to control molecular weight, chain branching, and other properties of the resulting polymer.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Environmental Remediation: In environmental applications, batch reactors can be employed for treating hazardous waste and contaminated water. They facilitate the treatment of small volumes at a time, making them suitable for tackling localized pollution problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Research and Development: Batch reactors are extensively used in laboratories and research facilities to develop new chemical processes, explore reaction kinetics, and study the feasibility of various reactions on a small scale before scaling up to continuous processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, batch reactors are versatile and widely used in various industries due to their ability to handle diverse chemical processes efficiently, providing a cost-effective and controlled method for producing a wide range of products.\n",

This means that batch reactor mole balances will inherently involve time dependent behavior and therefore $\\frac{dN_i}{dt}$ will not be zero. As the system is assumed to be perfectly mixed (generally a good assumption) the term $G_i = \\int^V r_i\\:d = r_iV$ or $G_i = \\int^W r'_i\\:d = r_iW$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Semi-batch reactors are a type of chemical reactor that combines features of both batch reactors and continuous flow reactors. In semi-batch reactors, one or more reactants are continuously fed into the reactor while the other reactants are added in a batch mode. This configuration allows for better control over the reaction conditions and offers increased flexibility in managing complex chemical processes.\n",

    "2. Specialty Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals: Semi-batch reactors find applications in the production of specialty chemicals and pharmaceutical intermediates, where the continuous addition of reagents allows for optimized reaction kinetics and better product quality control.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Crystallization: In crystallization processes, semi-batch reactors are employed to control the addition of solvents or anti-solvents, leading to the controlled growth of crystals and desired crystal size distribution.\n",

    "4. Wastewater Treatment: Semi-batch reactors can be used in wastewater treatment processes, where the continuous addition of reactants, catalysts, or adsorbents optimizes the treatment efficiency for specific pollutants.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Biodiesel Production: The transesterification process used in biodiesel production often utilizes semi-batch reactors. Continuous feeding of alcohol and oil feedstocks enhances the conversion rate and allows for more efficient processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Chemical Synthesis and Catalysis: Semi-batch reactors are valuable tools for chemical synthesis and catalysis, particularly when handling sensitive reactions or those with variable reaction rates. The ability to carefully control reagent addition can improve yield and selectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Metallurgy: In metallurgical applications, semi-batch reactors can be used for alloying processes, where metals are continuously added to a melt to achieve the desired composition and properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Energy Storage: In energy storage applications, such as the production of batteries and supercapacitors, semi-batch reactors allow for controlled electrodeposition and electrolyte addition, resulting in improved performance and stability of the energy storage devices.\n",

    "In summary, semi-batch reactors offer a valuable middle ground between batch and continuous flow reactors, allowing for better control over reaction conditions, improved product quality, and increased flexibility in managing a wide range of chemical processes across various industries. Their ability to handle continuous feeding of reagents makes them well-suited for processes with variable reaction rates or where precise control over reactant addition is crucial for achieving desired product characteristics.\n",

    "## Continuously Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTRs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTRs) are a common type of chemical reactor used in industrial processes for continuous production. Unlike batch reactors where all reactants are added at the beginning and allowed to react, CSTRs maintain a steady flow of reactants into the reactor while simultaneously removing the product, ensuring a constant reaction environment within the vessel. This is achieved through continuous stirring, which ensures thorough mixing and uniform conditions throughout the reactor.\n",
    "\n",
    "General Applications of CSTRs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Chemical Manufacturing: CSTRs are widely used in the chemical industry for various processes, including the synthesis of chemicals, production of intermediates, and the manufacture of specialty compounds. Their continuous operation allows for efficient and consistent production of chemicals at a controlled rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals: CSTRs are essential in biotechnological processes such as fermentation, where microorganisms or enzymes are used to produce biofuels, enzymes, antibiotics, and other valuable products. In the pharmaceutical industry, CSTRs are employed for continuous drug synthesis and pharmaceutical intermediate production.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Water Treatment: Continuous stirred tank reactors are utilized in water treatment plants for processes like activated sludge treatment, denitrification, and biological nutrient removal. The continuous flow ensures the consistent treatment of wastewater and optimal conditions for microorganisms involved in the purification process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Food and Beverage Production: CSTRs find application in the food and beverage industry for processes like fermentation, brewing, and dairy production. They enable the controlled growth of microorganisms or the conversion of raw materials into various food products.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Petrochemical and Oil Refining: CSTRs are utilized in various stages of petrochemical and oil refining processes, including catalytic cracking, alkylation, and hydrotreating, where continuous operation is beneficial for high throughput and process efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Environmental Applications: CSTRs can be used in environmental remediation to treat contaminated soil and water continuously. For example, soil washing and bioremediation processes benefit from steady-state conditions in a CSTR.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Energy Production: In bioenergy applications, CSTRs are used in anaerobic digestion to produce biogas (methane) from organic waste materials continuously. This biogas can then be used as a renewable energy source.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Polymerization: CSTRs can be employed in continuous polymerization processes to produce polymers with consistent molecular weights and properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSTRs are favored for their steady-state operation, simplicity, and scalability. They are particularly useful in processes requiring precise control over reaction conditions and continuous production of chemicals, making them an integral part of various industrial sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"CSTR.jpg\" alt=\"CSTR\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In industry CSTRs are usually operated at \"[steady-state](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/steady%20state#:~:text=%3A%20a%20state%20or%20condition%20of,negligibly%20over%20a%20specified%20time)\", however in this course both transient and steady state solution of the CSTR mole balance is required and therefore the mole balance is the same as that for the semi-batch reactor. **Perfect mixing is also assumed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{i0}-F_i+r'_iW=\\frac{dN_i}{dt}$$ or $$F_{i0}-F_i+r_iV=\\frac{dN_i}{dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At steady state, this mole balance reduces to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{i0}-F_i=-r'_iW = -r_iV$$\n",
    "\n",
    "See this video for more details on the derivation of the steady state mole balance: [CSTR mole balance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j2SbR3uLbg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that this implies that the steady state system \"jumps\" to a final outlet condition which is representative of the contents of reactor (i.e. the outlet has the same concentration, temperature, composition, etc. as the reactor itself due to perfect mixing in the system). This means that an algebraic solution of the steady state mole balance is required which can complicate the solution somewhat.  \n"

    "\n",
    "Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactors (CSTRs) in series are a configuration of multiple interconnected reactors used in chemical engineering and industrial processes to achieve complex reactions or improve overall system performance. CSTRs are a type of chemical reactor where reactants are continuously introduced, mixed, and allowed to react while the products are continuously removed from the reactor. When CSTRs are connected in series, the outlet stream of one reactor becomes the inlet stream for the next reactor, creating a sequential flow of reactants through the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The arrangement of CSTRs in series offers several advantages in comparison to single reactors, as it enables better control over reaction kinetics, residence time distribution, and temperature profile. By using multiple CSTRs in series, it becomes possible to achieve more extensive conversions and better reactant utilization. Additionally, this configuration allows for the implementation of different reaction conditions in each reactor, optimizing the overall process efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, operating CSTRs in series also presents challenges, such as increased complexity in design and control, potential pressure drop issues, and the need for precise residence time control to prevent undesirable reactions or unwanted by-products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, CSTRs in series provide a powerful and flexible approach to conduct intricate chemical reactions with enhanced efficiency and performance in various industrial applications, ranging from pharmaceuticals and petrochemicals to food and beverage production.\n",

    "\n",
    "However, the inlet flowrate for each reactor n would equal the outlet flowrate of each previous reactor (n-1), therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{i,n-1}-F_{i,k}+r'_{i,n}W=\\frac{dN_{i,n}}{dt}$$ or $$F_{i,n-1}-F_{i, n}+r_{i,n}V=\\frac{dN_{i,n}}{dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: if n = 1 the the inlet flow = $F_{i0}$\n",

    "## Reaction rates:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reaction rates are a fundamental concept in chemistry that describes how quickly a chemical reaction takes place. In every chemical reaction, reactants undergo a transformation to form products. The rate of a reaction quantifies the speed at which these reactants are consumed and products are formed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate of a reaction is influenced by several factors, including the concentration of reactants, temperature, pressure (for gas-phase reactions), and the presence of catalysts. Higher concentrations of reactants generally lead to faster reactions, as more collisions between particles occur, increasing the likelihood of successful reactions. Similarly, an increase in temperature usually accelerates the reaction rate since particles have more kinetic energy, resulting in more frequent and energetic collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate equation of a reaction is an expression that mathematically represents the relationship between the rate of the reaction and the concentrations of the reactants. Different reactions exhibit different rate laws, which can be determined through experimental measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding reaction rates is crucial in various fields, such as chemical engineering, pharmaceutical development, environmental studies, and many other industrial applications. By studying and controlling reaction rates, scientists and engineers can optimize processes, design efficient reactions, and produce desired products with high yields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the study of reaction rates provides valuable insights into the dynamics of chemical reactions, helping us comprehend the intricacies of the natural world and enabling us to manipulate chemical processes for practical purposes.\n",

The definition is defined with respect to the stoichiometric number (or stoichiometric coefficient as per ) - $\\nu_{ij}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Rate of reaction of component *i* in reaction *j* ($r_{ij}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The $r_{ij}$ can be defined as the rate at which component *i* reacts in reaction *j* - $r_{ij}$ tends to be described by the [Law of mass action](https://www.britannica.com/science/law-of-mass-action) and will differ for the different reactions (*j*) in the system. This will be addressed in more detail later in the course.\n",

    "$$ \\dot{\\varepsilon_j} = \\frac{d\\varepsilon_j}{dt} = \\frac{dn_{ij}}{dt}\\frac{1}{\\nu_{ij}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>It is important to note that \"conversion\" (*x*) which will be used later in this course is dimensionless and relates to the fraction of a reagent (usually the limiting reagent) which has be consumed during the reaction. Clearly $\\dot\\varepsilon$ is not directly related to *x* as $\\dot\\varepsilon$ would have units of $\\frac{mol}{time}$ while a rate of conversion (x) would only have units of \"per time\". </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Smith, van Ness and Abbott this term $\\dot\\varepsilon_j$ can be applied in a CSTR for the reaction *j* $aA + bB \\to cC$ as follows:\n",

    "$$\\dot{\\varepsilon_j} =  \\frac{\\Delta F_{ij}}{\\nu_{ij}} = \\frac{\\Delta F_{Aj}}{-a} = \\frac{\\Delta F_{Bj}}{-b} = \\frac{\\Delta F_{Cj}}{c} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it would be useful to link the $r_{j}$ to $\\dot\\varepsilon_j$, this can be done by looking at the definition of the $\\dot\\varepsilon_j$ for a CSTR.\n",
